# TO DO LIST

1. Clean up, by making components and merge common features, as well as utilizing react on dom generation, not by adding classes to display things
2. Remove the -All- attribute, and display 'No Spells Found' or something along those lines if there is no spells 
3. Allow an on/off functionality for each of the buttons, so that you can select a few levels and display those
4. Add a Pin for each of the spells, if selected, it adds a query to the URL, moves the pinned spell away from the listing, and is easily accessible. Also, maybe a quick copy button if URL contains a ?spells=1,4,5 etc
5. Make a front page which shows 3 buttons - Spells List, Dice Rolling and Character Sheet? CONCEPT LEVEL STILL
