For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. <br><b>Spells. </b><br>Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. <br><b>Magic Items. </b><br>The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere.

Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer withinthe sphere. <br><b>Dispel Magic. </b><br>Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere.

If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. <br><br><b>Part Water</b> <br>You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. <br><br><b>Redirect Flow</b> <br>You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions.

If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried."
